Regression Exercise with XGBoost Classifier
This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a classification model using the XGBoost algorithm in Python. The example is structured as a Python script (Regression_Ex.ipynb), guiding you through data preparation, model training, and evaluation.

# Project Overview

Key steps in the project:

Data Preprocessing: Loading and preparing the dataset
Model Training: Using the XGBClassifier from XGBoost
Model Evaluation: Calculating the model's accuracy (72.83%) on test data

# Requirements
Before running the script, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

xgboost; 
scikit-learn; 
numpy; 
pandas; 

# Results
The best result was acgieved by XGBoost classifier with an accuracy of 72.83% on the test dataset. The results might be improved by improving the hyperparameters .
